# Agentic AI Portfolio Manager

This project demonstrates how **Agentic AI** can be applied to quantitative finance and portfolio management.  
It is built around the **Unified 5 Pillars of Agentic AI**, blending conceptual clarity and engineering rigor.  

---

## 🌐 Project Overview
The **Agentic AI Portfolio Manager** is a multi-agent system that:
- Ingests financial market data (structured).
- Enriches it with indicators and backtests trading strategies.
- Integrates unstructured context (e.g., news sentiment).
- Coordinates specialized agents (Strategy, Risk, Allocator, Reporting).
- Produces optimized allocations with natural-language explanations.
- Runs as an interactive Streamlit app for non-technical users.

## 🔑 Unified 5 Pillars of Agentic AI

### 1. Agentic Orchestration & Autonomy
- **Concept:** Agents act on goals, adapt in real time, and compose actions without micromanagement.  
- **Implementation:** Multi-agent loop coordinated via Python modules and containerized services.

### 2. Data Intelligence (Structured + Unstructured)
- **Concept:** Agents must understand numbers *and* narratives.  
- **Implementation:**  
  - Structured data → OHLCV (prices, volumes) with indicators.  
  - Unstructured data → News sentiment / NLP signals for market context.

### 3. Reasoning, Planning & Optimization
- **Concept:** Agents simulate, reflect, and optimize trade-offs (e.g., Sharpe vs drawdown).  
- **Implementation:** Purged CV, walk-forward backtests, vectorized calculations, portfolio optimization.

### 4. Multi-Agent Collaboration & Alignment
- **Concept:** Specialized agents debate and align (Strategy vs. Risk vs. Allocator).  
- **Implementation:** Message-passing between Strategy, Risk, Allocator, and Reporting Agents, with compliance guardrails.

### 5. Explainability, Observability & Trust
- **Concept:** Decisions must be transparent, auditable, and human-readable.  
- **Implementation:** Logging, audit trails, drift detection, NL reporting agent, SHAP for model explainability.

## 📊 Deliverables
- **Jupyter Notebooks** → data ingestion, enrichment, backtests.  
- **Multi-Agent Python Modules** → strategy, risk, allocator, reporting.  
- **Streamlit App** → user-friendly interface with charts and reports.  
- **Documentation** → README + architecture diagram mapping to pillars.
